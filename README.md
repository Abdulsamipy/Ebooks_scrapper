**Description:**

This script is designed to scrape book data from ebooks.com. It fetches information such as title, price, description, author, and cover image of books listed on the website and saves the data into an Excel file for further analysis or usage.

**Dependencies:**

- `requests`: To send HTTP requests and retrieve web pages.
- `re`: Regular expression library for pattern matching.
- `threading`: For concurrency to improve scraping performance.
- `concurrent.futures`: For asynchronous execution of tasks.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and exporting data to Excel.

**Usage:**

1. Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using pip:

   ```
   pip install requests pandas
   ```

2. Update the `test.txt` file with the URLs of the books you want to scrape. Each URL should be on a separate line.

3. Run the script. It will scrape the book data concurrently using multiple threads, improving the scraping speed.

4. After execution, the scraped book data will be saved into an Excel file named `books_data.xlsx` in the same directory as the script.

**Important Notes:**

- This script utilizes threading for concurrent scraping. Adjust the `max_workers` parameter in the `ThreadPoolExecutor` to control the number of concurrent threads based on your system's capabilities and the website's server limitations.
- Ensure that you have proper permissions to scrape data from ebooks.com and abide by their terms of service.
- This script is provided as-is and may require modifications to adapt to changes in the website's structure or API responses.
- Use responsibly and considerate of the website's resources to avoid causing any disruptions or overloading the server.
